## 3. Plugin Notes & Observations

### Callout Manager (eth-p) — Closest Relative

The clearest overlap. Callout Manager does CSS detection and custom type creation well, and has a plugin API that other plugins depend on (Callout Suggestions, Callout Toggles optionally). It does **not** insert callouts — it is a management and discovery layer only. ECM subsumes its management features while adding a full insertion workflow, icon packs, import/export, and color injection. ECM does not expose a plugin API, which means it cannot replace Callout Manager for users who rely on dependent plugins.

### Callout Toggles — Keyboard-First Power User Tool

Generates one command per callout type, enabling direct hotkey assignment for every type. This is a different UX model than ECM's 5-slot favorites — Callout Toggles is better for users who want 10+ individual hotkeys. It also has a unique feature: retaining custom titles when removing callouts, and promoting headings to callout titles. No management or creation capability.

### Callout Menu — Right-Click Switcher

Adds callout type switching and collapse toggling to the right-click context menu. Minimal overlap with ECM — it solves the "I already have a callout and want to change its type" workflow, not insertion or creation. Available via BRAT only (not in the community plugin store).

### CalloutX — CSS-Backed Visual Editor

Reads and writes a dedicated `custom-callouts.css` file. Users can create, edit, delete, and search callouts visually, but everything is backed by CSS file edits. Desktop only. No insertion capability. ECM's approach (color injection + JSON storage) avoids requiring a separate CSS file, but CalloutX's explicit CSS-file model may appeal to users who prefer direct CSS control.

### Callout Suggestions — Autocomplete Trigger

Very narrow scope: type `>!` in the editor to trigger an autocomplete modal. Requires Callout Manager to function. ECM's quick-pick mode covers a similar use case without requiring a dependency. Minimal overlap otherwise.

### Tangential / Non-Competing Plugins

The following plugins use callout syntax as a vehicle for an unrelated feature, not as their primary purpose. They are not meaningful competitors:

- **Callout Integrator** — converts plain text to callout format by adding `>` prefixes
- **Callout Copy Buttons** — adds copy buttons (MD + plain text) to existing callout blocks
- **List Callouts** — character-triggered callout-style styling within list items
- **Citation Callouts** — pastes clipboard citations as formatted callout blocks
- **Inline Admonitions** — styles inline code blocks, not standard callouts
- **Inline Callouts (Badges v2)** — inline key-value badges with icon support; separate concept from block callouts
- **Math in Callout** — fixes MathJax rendering inside callouts in Live Preview
- **File Tree Generator** — generates directory trees using callout syntax
- **Get Stock Information** — inserts Yahoo Finance data into a callout block
- **Keyboard Shortcuts** — general nav plugin with a single configurable callout insert command
- **Badges** — predecessor to Inline Callouts; inline key-value store badges
- **Personal Assistant** — multi-purpose vault automation plugin; callout listing is a minor feature

## 4. Where Enhanced Callout Manager Stands Out

Unique capabilities not found in any competing plugin:

| Unique Feature | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| Full insertion + management in one plugin | No other plugin does both; users currently need Callout Manager + Callout Toggles/Suggestions to approximate this |
| 4 icon sources (Lucide, FA, Octicons, RPG Awesome) | No other callout plugin supports icon packs beyond Lucide |
| Upload custom image as icon | Completely unique — no other plugin allows this |
| Import/export types as JSON | Enables sharing and backing up callout type libraries |
| Export types as a CSS snippet | Useful for theme/snippet authors; no other plugin does this |
| CSS snippet warning system | Actively diagnoses malformed CSS; Callout Manager detects but doesn't warn |
| Color injection (no CSS required) | Custom types work without writing any CSS; closest competitor (Callout Manager) still requires CSS for display |
| Quick-pick mode | Rapid insertion without filling out the full modal — faster than any competing workflow |

## 5. Gaps & Honest Weaknesses

| Gap | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| No plugin API | Callout Manager's API is used by Callout Suggestions and Callout Toggles. ECM cannot replace CM for users of those plugins. |
| No per-type hotkeys (unlimited) | Callout Toggles generates one command per type; ECM's 5-slot model won't satisfy power users who want 10+ hotkeys |
| No right-click context menu | Callout Menu's UX (switch type without leaving context) is unmatched by ECM |
| No title/type retain on unwrap | Callout Toggles preserves custom titles when removing callouts — ECM has no remove/unwrap feature |
| No theme callout detection | Callout Manager detects types from themes, not just snippets. ECM only scans snippets. |
| Mobile support unclear | README does not state mobile compatibility; Callout Manager explicitly supports it |
