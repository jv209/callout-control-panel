# Mobile Workflow

This workflow covers phones and tablets running Obsidian Mobile (iOS and Android).

## Option A: Mobile toolbar button

The mobile toolbar gives you one-tap access to callout insertion.

### Setup

1. Open **Settings > Mobile**
2. Under **Configure mobile toolbar**, add **Insert callout (quick pick)**
3. The quick pick icon appears in your toolbar

### Using it

1. Place your cursor in the editor
2. Tap the quick pick icon in the toolbar
3. Select a callout type from the list
4. The callout block is inserted at your cursor

You can also add individual favorite callout commands to the toolbar for one-tap access to specific types (see [Favorite Callouts Workflow](Favorite-Callouts-Workflow)).

## Option B: Command palette

The command palette works on mobile the same way it does on desktop.

1. Open the command palette (swipe down or tap the menu icon, depending on your device)
2. Search for "Insert callout" or "Insert callout (quick pick)"
3. Select the command

This gives you access to both the full modal and the quick pick without using toolbar space.

## Combining approaches

A practical mobile setup:

- **Toolbar button** for the quick pick (your most frequent action — always visible, one tap)
- **Command palette** for the full modal (when you need to set a title or collapse state)
- **Toolbar buttons** for 1–2 favorite callout types you use constantly

The ribbon icon is hidden on mobile since Obsidian's mobile interface does not use the ribbon. The toolbar and command palette cover the same functionality.
