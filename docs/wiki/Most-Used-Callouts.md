# Most Used Callouts (Favorites)

The Most Used Callouts tab lets you assign up to 5 callout types to dedicated command slots. Each slot becomes a command you can bind to a hotkey or add to the mobile toolbar.

## Setting up favorites

1. Open **Settings > Callout Control Panel > Most Used Callouts**
2. For each slot (Favorite 1–5), select a callout type from the dropdown
3. Select "— (none)" to leave a slot empty

The dropdown shows all available types grouped by source: Custom, Snippet, and Default.

## Using favorites

Each assigned slot registers a command in Obsidian:

- **Insert favorite callout 1**
- **Insert favorite callout 2**
- **Insert favorite callout 3**
- **Insert favorite callout 4**
- **Insert favorite callout 5**

### Hotkeys (desktop)

1. Open **Settings > Hotkeys**
2. Search for "Insert favorite callout"
3. Assign a key combination to each slot you've configured

### Mobile toolbar

1. Open **Settings > Mobile > Configure mobile toolbar**
2. Add one or more "Insert favorite callout" commands
3. Tap the toolbar icon to insert that callout type

## How it works

- Favorites insert a bare callout block (like the quick pick), using the **Default collapse state (quick pick)** setting for the fold state
- The "Remember last used type" setting also applies to favorites
- Changing the type assigned to a slot takes effect immediately — no restart needed
- Empty slots (set to "— (none)") do nothing when triggered
