# Desktop Keyboard Workflow

This workflow is for keyboard-driven users on desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) who want the fastest possible callout insertion.

## Option A: Hotkeys for the modal or quick pick

You can assign a hotkey to either of the two insertion commands:

- **Insert callout** — opens the full modal with type selection, title, collapse state, and content fields
- **Insert callout (quick pick)** — opens a lightweight type picker that inserts a bare callout block immediately

### Setup

1. Open **Settings > Hotkeys**
2. Search for "Insert callout"
3. Assign a key combination to one or both commands

### When to use which

| Command | Best for |
|---------|----------|
| Full modal | When you want to set a title, collapse state, or content up front |
| Quick pick | When you just need a callout block and will fill in the details inline |

With the full modal, you can press **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter** to insert without reaching for the mouse.

## Option B: Command palette

If you prefer not to memorize hotkeys, or you use callouts less frequently:

1. Press **Ctrl/Cmd+P** to open the command palette
2. Type "insert callout" or "quick pick"
3. Select the command

This works the same as a hotkey — it just takes an extra step to get there.

## Option C: Ribbon icon

The ribbon icon opens the quick pick modal with a single click. It appears automatically when the plugin is active (desktop only).

## Combining approaches

Nothing stops you from using all three. A common setup:

- **Hotkey** for the quick pick (your most frequent action)
- **Command palette** for the full modal (used less often, so no hotkey needed)
- **Ribbon icon** as a visual reminder that the plugin is there

These are suggestions, not rules. Use whatever combination feels natural.
