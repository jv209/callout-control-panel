## Callout Plugin Naming Discussion

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User

Working in a name for a plugin for obsidian.md.

Worked with another ai to get started. This is the current state of
conversation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good, I have all the READMEs. Before diving into the full comparison,
let me address your naming question since that's what you asked first.
Your plugin is genuinely a superset of what "Callout Manager" does, plus
a lot more. The name needs to convey that it's a unified, all-in-one
tool. Some directions to consider: Emphasizing the "all-in-one" angle: ∙
Callout Suite ∙ Callout Hub ∙ Callout Workshop ∙ Callout Studio ∙
Callout Forge Emphasizing the insertion/management workflow: ∙ Callout
Composer ∙ Callout Architect ∙ Callout Toolkit ∙ Callout Command
Emphasizing speed/power-user feel: ∙ Callout Commander ∙ Callout Pro ∙
Callout Master ∙ Quick Callout A bit more distinctive: ∙ Calloutery
(playful, memorable) ∙ Callout Nexus (hub of everything) ∙ Callout
Atelier (workshop/studio feel) My personal picks would be Callout
Studio, Callout Commander, or Callout Workshop --- they each imply a
full-featured environment rather than just a single-purpose tool, and
none of them step on "Callout Manager" directly. Do any of those
directions resonate with you, or would you like me to riff in a
different direction before we get into the full comparison?

The plugin was inspired by the ease of using a hotkey to launch a modal
that let me set callout type, its state (open, closed, collapsible) and
the note. You could also select text, hit the hotkey and pre-populate
the text field in the modal.

Then I saw another plugin that let you see all the css user-created
snippets for callouts, and one that let you create it internally, and I
wanted to have a way of managing all of that in one central way.

I also added my own idea of having a quick pick option from the command
palette, since I know there's people who prefer that workflow. And this
approach in particular is, in my mind, the most convenient for a
phone/mobile device. iPads and tablets can use keyboard and therefore
hotkeys so there are in my mind two basic ways of executing the use of
the callout function.

### User

I guess the one issue is that none of these really point to what the
plugin does. But, is that really a problem?

### User

Do the audit and propose the names with rationale.

What name is used in Star Trek to describe the panels where work is
done? A workstation?

### User

Let's go in this direction.

### Assistant

(Refinement toward Callout Console and similar names.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User

What about callout engineer? Riff on that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant

(Analysis of Engineer vs Console vs Architect framing.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User

Let's look at synonyms for engineer. Not literal, but conceptual ones.
The plugin is robust but it plays on people's natural tendencies.

The one I find is I don't like having to manually type in the callout
structure. I imagine more people are like that. Saving those 2-3 seconds
feels like a productivity win. However marginal that is.

### Assistant

(Exploration of Optimizer, Flow, Momentum, Craft, etc.)

### User

To make using callouts simple, quick, and feel effortless.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant

(Refinement toward Flow, Swift, QuickCallout, etc.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User

Call out flow feels too nebulous.

I like the direction we were in with engineer and the Star Trek theme.
Even if it was more technical.

My sense is that people who like obsidian like to tinker with their
systems. I want to play into that.

I believe once a person sees what's possible they will not be hindered
by the name. So I'm willing to take a risk in that direction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant

(Refinement toward Callout Systems, Engineer, Forge, etc.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User

These are names I've been mulling over: 1. Callout Control Panel 2.
Callout Controller 3. Callout Genie

1 is in line with what we have been discussing. 2. Is a play on some
other plugin names I've seen. 3 is a bit more whimsical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant

(Comparative analysis recommending Callout Control Panel.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User

I'm closer to 90% with this. Do the three tasks you mentioned.

### Assistant

(Discoverability stress test, plugin directory mock, branding language.)

### User

can you export this chat in a .md file.
